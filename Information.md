# What is Machine Learning

## Supervised learning

By showing tons of examples of what we want to a computer, it will learn about it (super simplification). That is supervised learning. 

# Data Science

Turning data into value. 

## Data mining

The application of specific algorithms for extracting patterns from data. 

## Business intelligence

Using this harvested data to be able to market your products in a more efficient way. 

## Hierarchy of (Data Science) needs

From lowest to highest: 

### Collect
Instrumentation, logging, sensors, external data, user generated content

### Move/Store

Reliable data flow, infrastructure, pipelines, etl, structured and unstructured data storage

### Explore/Transform

Cleaning, anomaly detection, prep

### Aggregate/Label

Analytics, metrics, segments, aggregates, features, training data

### Learn/optimize

A/B testing, experimentation, simple ML algorithms

### AI, Deep Learning

## Steps to solve a problem

### Formulate question

it is the most important step. It will affect everything: the research, the kind of data to gather, etc. 

### Gather data

Gather the data that you think will help you solve the problem 

### Clean data

In the real world, the data you get is messy. So, you have to clean it and prepare it

### Explore and visualize

See the gathered data, which will help you understand better 

### Train algorithm

In this case, linear regression (for a first step)

### Evaluate

Evaluate the results from your algorithm / model
